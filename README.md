# 🧩 Portfolio Website

Personal portfolio website developed to showcase my work, technical skills, and approach as a software developer.

This project focuses on clean frontend architecture, real-world integrations, and a modern, maintainable UI.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Angular** (standalone components, modern architecture)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **EmailJS** (client-side email service)
- **Vercel** (deployment)

## 📩 Contact Form (EmailJS Integration)
The contact form is implemented using **EmailJS**, allowing emails to be sent directly from the client without a custom backend.

This integration includes:
- Secure configuration using environment variables
- Real-time email delivery to a personal inbox

- Seamless integration within an Angular application

This setup demonstrates the ability to integrate third-party services into a frontend-only architecture while maintaining functionality and reliability.
